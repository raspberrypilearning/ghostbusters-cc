## Random ghosts

Your ghost is really easy to catch at the moment, because it doesn't move!

--- task ---

Can you add code to your ghost so that, instead of staying in the same position, the ghost appears at random positions on the Stage?

--- hints ---

--- hint ---

Each time before your ghost appears, it should `go to`{:class="block3motion"} a random position on the Stage.

There are two sets of code blocks you could use here. Choose the set you prefer.

Either add this set of blocks to your ghost sprite:

```blocks3
go to (random position v)
```
Or add this one to your sprite:

```blocks3
go to x: (14) y: (50)

pick random (1) to (10)

pick random (1) to (10)
```

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

Your code could look either like this:

![ghost-sprite](images/ghost-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
hide
wait (1) seconds
go to (random position v)
show
wait (1) seconds
end
```

Or it could look like this:

![ghost-sprite](images/ghost-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
hide
wait (1) seconds
go to x: (pick random (-150) to (150)) y: (pick random (-150) to (150))
show
wait (1) seconds
end
```
