Now you're going to make your game more interesting by keeping score!

Can you keep track of the player's score? Players should score points when they click on ghosts to catch them.

Each time a player clicks on a ghost, their score should increase.

`When the green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, your `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable should be `set to 0`{:class="block3variables"}. The Stage is the best place to add this code.

`When the ghost sprite is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, the `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable should be `changed by 1`{:class="block3variables"}.
